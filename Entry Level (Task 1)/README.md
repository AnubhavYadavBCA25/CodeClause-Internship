Project Level: Entry Level

#### Project Summary
The project "EDA on Iris Dataset" is an entry-level data science internship project. The main objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. EDA involves analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights and understand the patterns and relationships within the data. Through this project, I have the opportunity to apply various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the Iris dataset and draw meaningful conclusions. This project serves as a great starting point for me interested in data science and provides hands-on experience in data analysis.
