# Golden Level (Task 3)

### Project Details 
- Project ID: #CC69858
- Project Title: Heart Disease Risk Assessment
- Internship Domain - Data Science Intern
- Project Level: Golden Level

#### Project Summary
The project titled "Heart Disease Risk Assessment" aims to build a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their health metrics. Using machine learning techniques, such as the Random Forest algorithm, the project aims to predict the risk of heart disease based on the input data. The technologies used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit for the user interface. Through this project, we will gain experience in UI design (Web Application) for health applications and learn about cardiovascular risk factors and classification techniques.

#### Project Detials:
- **Aim:** Build a UI allowing users to input health metrics. Develop a machine learning model
to predict the risk of heart disease.
- **Description:** Create a user-friendly interface for inputting health data and implement a model
(e.g., Random Forest) for risk assessment.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn and Streamlit (UI).
- **What We Learn:** UI design for health applications, cardiovascular risk factors, classification.
